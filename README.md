# My experience about resolving technical issue:
1. Alway must understand correctly about technical issue
2. Should solve by you first, alway find a best solution before reference to some document. And then combine with documentation, then you can reference it, and use document in the good way to make sure we solve it more deeply and more perfectly (document is very important beside your skill and knowledge)
3. Use all of tool we can use to solve technical issue
4. List all of the ways we can solve it, then choose a best solution
5. Break down issue to small issue to solve it in correct way and perfect way
6. Understand deeply is the key for any technical issue
7. Should know about algorithm / data structure knowledge, it's really useful 
8. Solve and test carefully to make sure no side effect and make sure code we write more clean, easy to understand for other people


# Other issue
- Sometime I design good architecture for project not satify with my expect, it's must work and follow CLEAN architect, SOLID rule. Some time it's take my time to consider choose a good solution
- Some technical issue I faced often because it's quite new to me, to learn it quickly, I must learn by practical, do some research base on example, small project, and choose best resource to read (Apple documentation, WWDC video, Medium, some good quality blog)
- Some technical have less comunity and document, in this case, I must research by myself and must understand the technical in deep, find the way to understand it in deep way and more productive way. First of all, I must keep good attitude, positive and balance, then I must break it to small task, and do step by step, to understand more deeply, more perfect
